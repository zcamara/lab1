        <h1>Superman / Clark Kent</h1>

        <p>Born on the distant planet of Krypton, Kal-El was sent to Earth by his father to escape the dying planet's doom. The boy was found, adopted, and raised by a Kansas farm family. Through adoption, he recieved the name Clark Kent and inherited very strong morals. As a child, Clark developed amazing superhuman abilities such as x-ray vision, flight, and near-invincibility. In fact, his only weakness is Kyrptonite (radioactive meteorites of his destroyed home planet). Upon reaching adulthood, Clark decided to use his abilities to help mankind. While working as a journalist for <i>The Daily Planet</i>, Clark also assumed the identity of Superman, a hero for humanity.</p>
